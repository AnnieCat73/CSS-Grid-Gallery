## My process

- I wanted to create a responsive image gallery with CSS Grid.
- The gallery was populated with images from Unsplash.com.
- The gallery has different kinds of images.
- If you refresh the page the gallery will upload new images for each image category.
- By hovering over an image you will see which category it belongs to while it also animates!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- CSS animation

### What I learned

I found this to be a good use case for CSS Grid. 

### Continued development

I will continue to improve my layout skills and get more comfortable with CSS Grid.
